## A Word about the Project 
Fun project demonstrating my skills to write C++ programs, showing my passion to coding ⌨️ and sharing my sense of humor 🤣 among other developers to spread the joy of coding.


### Project Description 
The Program starts by prompting the user to ask if they want to drink tea or not. If so, the user will be prompted with
some questions to identify the tea type, amount of sugar and tea that he or she prefers. To make the project more exciting,
the user is notified if the amount of sugar or tea too much and, also the user is asked to choose his/her favorite mug or cup to drink their tea 
and finally, the program will finish by showing the user a simple image indicating the amount of sugar, amount of tea and 
also the tea type along side descriptive details about the order he/she had requested. I hope you enjoy using it. 
Happy Coding 🖥️😄, with a cup of tea ☕ !
